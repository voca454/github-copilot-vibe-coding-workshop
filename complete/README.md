## Containerization Sample

### Prerequisites

Refer to the [README](../README.md) doc for preparation.

### Getting Started

1. Make sure that Docker is running.

   ```bash
   docker info
   ```

1. Get the repository root.

   ```bash
   # bash/zsh
   REPOSITORY_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
   ```

   ```powershell
   # PowerShell
   $REPOSITORY_ROOT = git rev-parse --show-toplevel
   ```

1. Navigate to the `complete` directory.

   ```bash
   cd $REPOSITORY_ROOT/complete
   ```

1. Run the containerized apps.

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```

1. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3030`.
1. Verify if the web application is running properly.
1. Clean up by running the following command to remove the containerized apps.

   ```bash
   docker compose down --rmi all
   ```
